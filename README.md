# Project for V&V course 

This repository contains the project for the course of "Verifica e Validazione di sistemi software", started in June 2018. It is an application of a theoretical argument studied over the classes, called "Monte Carlo Model Checking".

## Getting Started

This project is still in the early stages yet. Since it is a university project, I don't know if I can give you the complete code and models used for testing and debugging the project. 

### Prerequisites

The project runs on Ubuntu and it requires few basic tools:
1) Matlab and Simulink, release R2018a
2) Bash
3) Python

```
You can install Matlab from mathworks.com
The other softwares are preinstalled with Ubuntu.
```

## Running the tests

As I said before, I cannot give you the complete code and the model used for testing. You can try to adapt the code to your own model.

The project started working on the Simulink model of the Automatic Transmission System and the model is composed by the following parts:
1) Original model.
2) Distubed model, on which we inject mutation on Control Logic.
3) Monitor which takes the output of the above models and compare them.

## Built With

* [MATLAB & Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/downloads/) - The software used in the project
