script:
    loop on experiments:
        N=samples(e,d)
        sh=crea_script_slurm(N)
        id=sbatch sh
        do
            res=squeue id   #monitora che sh sia terminata
        while(res is not empty)
        fetch the results

#1. Talk with Tronci to understand what are the experiments: varying on e1, d1, e2, d2? what range? how many?
CHOOSE e1, d1 AND RUN A SINGLE EXECUTION ON CLUSTER.

#2. Implement the above script.

#3. If possible, install slurm on this machine to test the script. IMPOSSIBLE.

#4. Talk with Melatti to execute this script on the cluster.

#5. Reasoning on minimum. Discard the 0 because we are interested to the sensitivity >0. If so then a mutation on dead code will bring the sensitivity to 0. Suppose that all the execution give sensitivity 0 and we discard them, then we conclude global sensitivity max (=1).
